# MP34tube-Downloader

As you can see in my repo there are two python file (.py) inside namely app.py and default.py 
default.py is actually the default source code that I got from a YouTube video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0hEmxOEeVO0)
which is also my project reference that I took inspiration from.

for the app.py is the main application that I have integrated the code from default.py while adding some features like convert next button and audio downloader tab.
